#Lazy scripts

This site contains sysadmin scripts that just work, because we are very lazy, thus more productive.

If you want to contribute with some awesome scripts, please make a pull request to https://github.com/lazyprogrammer-io/scripts-that-work

In order to have your contribution accepted, the scripts should be idempotent and have a Readme file.
